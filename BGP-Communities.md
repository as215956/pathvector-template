## Local preference

By default, customers/downstreams are imported to BGP with LocalPref 5000. However, we provides a LocalPref manipulation community that will allow you to control the link over which traffic comes in for active-passive backup purposes. You can set the LocalPref to 4000 by tagging the route with ASN:610:4000, which is still higher than non-customer routes.

| Community | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| ASN:610:x | Set local preference to [x] |

| LocalPref | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1000      | Upstream / Transit                            |
